After looking at the vision statement, I really liked the app idea. It was actually a game that I had played with friends in high school, and when we got 75 or so people to join, it definitely did become a game that was hard to organize. The one critique I have of the vision statement would just be to get into the details, like how exactly do you plan on simplifying this process? Can you search for games, or just get randomly assigned if there is more than one game going on? Things like that are things that might be nice to just touch on quickly.

Code Review - Prototype is a fine start to the app, as it is just a running prototype. Our group forgot to do this as well, but just make sure to document the code using JavaDoc formatting (document the MainActivity.java for what the file will be used for).
