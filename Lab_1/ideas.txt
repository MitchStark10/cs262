App Idea (tractable) - Recruiting app for coaches. I play on the men's soccer team here at Calvin, and got this
idea from my coach. He has said that there are currently no good apps (iOS) for coaches to keep track of and recruit
players. This would just use a simple list of players, along with stats about them, as well as notes that the coach has taken.

App Idea (wacky) - An app that would keep track of the campus parking spaces, and show where spots are open/taken to
make finding parking spaces easier for off-campus students.
